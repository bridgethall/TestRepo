Hi there this document is very very important
wow look at all my commits
In terms of actual real life serious commitments, I’m not a vegan or a vegetarian.
 But I am a person who likes to try new things and sometimes I get lazy 
about cooking meat, 
so a few months ago I bought three different spiralizers – those crazy
 machines that make vegetables into noodles. 
I wanted to try them and see which ones were best, and why they were awesome, 
and become a super healthy person with a few swirls of a spiralizer handle,
 and eventually talk about it in a post. In these last few weeks,
 I’ve just been a leeeetle too “busy” to get my act together and actually write about
 the spiralizers, but ironically, the thing that is keeping me busy is 
feeding my face bowls and bowls and bowls of spiralized sweet potato noodles
 covered in cashew sauce. It’s just so weird how that works.
